events:
  - name: state_updated
    summary: A event called when centrel manager state updated
    description: |
         Invoked whenever the central manager's state has been updated. Commands should only be issued when the state is
         Modules.BLE.CENTREL_MANAGER_STATE_POWERED_ON. A state below Modules.BLE.CENTREL_MANAGER_STATE_POWERED_ON
         implies that scanning has stopped and any connected peripherals have been disconnected. If the state moves below
         Modules.BLE.CENTREL_MANAGER_STATE_POWERED_OFF, all Peripheral objects obtained from this central
         manager become invalid and must be retrieved or discovered again.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    since: "1.0.0"

  - name: state_restore
    summary: A event called when centrel manager will restore state
    description: |
         For apps that opt-in to state preservation and restoration, this is the first event invoked when your app is relaunched into 
         the background to complete some Bluetooth-related task. Use this method to synchronize your app's state with the state of the
         Bluetooth system.

  - name: peripheral_discoverd
    summary: A event called when centrel manager discover peripheral
    description: |
         This method is invoked while scanning, upon the discovery of peripheral by central. A discovered peripheral must
         be retained in order to use it; otherwise, it is assumed to not be of interest and will be cleaned up by the central manager. For
         a list of discovered peripherals, see peripherals property
